				<h4> About Me:	</h4>
				<article>
									
						<p>
							My favorite sauce is Tomato Ketchup. I came to the USA in 2011. I grew up in Nepal, the country of Himalayas. 
							I don't like dogs. I like being alone. I grew up without internet access. My neighbors had TV in their houses. 
							Oh, and I have recently come out of a cult.

						<h4> How I feel about Internet	</h4>			
						<p>
							It is really not safe revealing too much information. There are prying eyes looking out for exploiting any opportunities.
							Online dating ? Not given a try. What a minute, they still have to decide in person to get married right ?

						<h4> Cryptocurrency	</h4>			
						<p>
							I wish I knew more about the investing methods. I, just like many others,jumped in the investing after surviving the pandemic. 
							Sometimes, it is red days, sometimes green. The goal is to buy low, and sell high. However, I am not very patient man. 
							I can't stand watching the losing $$$
